tldr: The user set up a Git repository for their Electron Messenger app,
  including pushing initial code and configuring a .gitignore. The main focus
  was then on modifying the Electron app to open external links in the default
  browser instead of new Electron windows, which was successfully implemented
  and deployed.
overview: The user initiated the conversation by setting up a Git repository for
  their Electron Messenger application, pushing an initial README, and then all
  project files after a  was created to exclude common build
  artifacts. The primary challenge was to modify the Electron app's behavior so
  that external links clicked within the Messenger webview would open in the
  user's default browser, rather than a new Electron window. The agent initially
  attempted a solution involving a  event listener in the renderer
  process and IPC communication. However, this proved insufficient, leading to a
  more robust implementation in the main process using
   to intercept and handle all new window
  requests from the webview. This ensured that only external URLs were opened
  via , while internal Messenger/Facebook links remained
  within the Electron app. The agent also managed the build process and
  deployment of the updated application to the user's  folder.
