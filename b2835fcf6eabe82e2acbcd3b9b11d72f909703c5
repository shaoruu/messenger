tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app and
  pushed the initial code. The agent then implemented a feature to open external
  links from the webview in the user's default browser instead of within the
  Electron window.
overview: The user started by setting up a new Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project, pushing an initial README. When asked to push everything,
  the agent identified untracked files and proactively created a
  file to exclude common build artifacts and dependencies like
  and  before committing and pushing the entire codebase. Subsequently,
  the user requested that links clicked within the Messenger app should open in
  the system's default browser rather than a new Electron window. The agent
  implemented this by modifying the Electron main, preload, and renderer
  processes. This involved using  and  in
  , exposing an  function via  in
  , and adding a  event listener to the webview in
   to intercept and redirect external URLs. The agent also debugged
  and resolved several TypeScript compilation issues during this implementation.
