tldr: The user wanted to initialize a Git repository and then configure their
  Electron Messenger app to open external links in the default browser instead
  of a new Electron window. The agent successfully implemented this by
  intercepting new window requests in the main process.
overview: The user started by initializing a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project and pushing an initial commit. They then requested to push
  all project files, which the agent handled by first creating a
  file to exclude common build artifacts and dependencies, then committing and
  pushing the remaining source code. The main task was to modify the Electron
  app so that any links clicked within the Messenger webview would open in the
  user's default web browser instead of a new Electron window. The agent
  initially tried to implement this by listening for  events in the
  renderer process and using IPC to open the URL externally. However, after the
  user reported this wasn't working for all links, the agent revised the
  approach to use  in the main process. This
  allowed for direct interception of new window requests from the webview,
  ensuring that only external URLs were opened in the default browser while
  Messenger/Facebook links remained within the app. The agent also addressed
  several TypeScript compilation issues and created a dedicated type declaration
  file for a cleaner solution. Finally, the updated Electron app was built and
  copied to the user's Applications folder.
