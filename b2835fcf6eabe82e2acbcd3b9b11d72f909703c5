tldr: The user wanted to set up a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app
  and ensure all project files were pushed. The main task involved configuring
  the Electron app to open external links in the default browser instead of new
  Electron windows, which required several iterations and debugging.
overview: The user's intent was to initialize a Git repository for an Electron
  Messenger application and configure it to open external links in the default
  browser. The agent first helped set up the Git repository, including creating
  a  file to exclude build artifacts and dependencies, and pushed
  all project files. For the external link functionality, the agent initially
  attempted to intercept  events in the renderer process. However,
  after user feedback and an image showing a persistent popup, the approach was
  refined to use  in the main process, which
  is the correct way to handle new window requests from webviews. TypeScript
  typing issues encountered during development were also resolved by introducing
  a  file. Finally, the agent built the arm64 macOS version of the
  app and replaced the existing application in the user's
  folder.
