tldr: The user initialized an Electron Messenger app, pushed it to GitHub, and
  then requested that external links within the app open in the default browser.
  The agent implemented this by intercepting new window requests in the main
  Electron process and deploying the updated application.
overview: >-
  The user began by setting up a new Git repository for an Electron-based
  Messenger application and pushing the initial project files to GitHub. During
  this initial setup, a  file was created to prevent unnecessary
  files like  and build artifacts from being committed.

  Subsequently, the user requested a feature where external links clicked within
  the Messenger app's webview would open in the system's default browser rather
  than a new Electron window. The agent initially attempted to implement this
  using a  event listener in the renderer process combined with IPC
  communication to the main process. However, this approach was found to be
  incomplete as some links still opened in a popup.

  The solution was refined by moving the external link handling to the main
  Electron process, utilizing  to intercept
  all new window requests from the webview. This ensured that any URL not
  belonging to  or  would be opened externally
  using . The agent also refactored TypeScript type
  declarations into a  file for cleaner code. After each
  significant change, the application was rebuilt and deployed to the
   folder, with the arm64 macOS  bundle being successfully
  updated despite consistent failures in the DMG build process.
