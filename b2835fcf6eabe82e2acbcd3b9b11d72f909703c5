tldr: The user initialized a Git repository, pushed their Electron Messenger
  project to GitHub, and then requested that external links within the app open
  in the default browser. The agent implemented this by intercepting new window
  requests in the main process and opening external URLs using the system's
  default browser.
overview: The conversation began with the user setting up a Git repository for
  their Electron Messenger project and pushing it to GitHub. The agent assisted
  by creating a  file to exclude common build artifacts and
  dependencies before the initial push. The main task then shifted to ensuring
  that external links clicked within the Messenger app would open in the user's
  default web browser rather than a new Electron window. Initially, the agent
  attempted a solution in the renderer process, but this proved incomplete. The
  approach was refined to intercept new window requests directly in the main
  process using Electron's  and
  . After successfully implementing and building the
  changes, the agent replaced the user's existing Messenger application in the
  Applications folder with the updated version.
