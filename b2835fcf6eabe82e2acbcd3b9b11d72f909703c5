tldr: The user initialized a Git repository, pushed all project files after
  creating a , and then requested to open external links from the
  Electron app in the default browser. The agent successfully implemented this
  by modifying the main, preload, and renderer processes to intercept webview
  new-window events and use .
overview: The user started by initializing a Git repository for their messenger
  project and pushing an initial commit. They then asked to push all project
  files, which led the agent to proactively create a  file to
  exclude common build artifacts and dependencies before committing and pushing
  the rest of the codebase. Following this, the user requested that any links
  clicked within the Electron messenger application should open in the system's
  default browser rather than a new Electron window. The agent addressed this by
  modifying the Electron application's , , and
  processes. Specifically,  was updated to use  and
  ,  was updated to expose an
  function to the renderer process, and  was modified to listen for
   events on the webview, determine if the URL was external, and
  then use the exposed  function to open it in the default
  browser. The agent also resolved several TypeScript compilation issues during
  this process to ensure a successful build.
