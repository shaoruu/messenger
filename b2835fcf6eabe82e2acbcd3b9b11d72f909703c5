tldr: The user wanted to set up their Electron Messenger project on GitHub and
  ensure that all external links clicked within the app open in the default
  system browser instead of a new Electron window. The agent helped initialize
  the repository, configure , and implemented a robust solution
  using Electron's  in the main process.
overview: The user's primary intent was to get their Electron Messenger project
  properly version-controlled on GitHub and to modify its behavior regarding
  external links. Initially, the agent helped set up the Git repository,
  including creating a  file to prevent unnecessary files from being
  committed. The core challenge was to make external links open in the user's
  default browser rather than within a new Electron window. The agent first
  attempted a solution in the renderer process using
   and an IPC bridge. However, when this
  proved insufficient for all popup scenarios, the agent pivoted to a more
  robust approach in the main process, utilizing
   and  to
  intercept and handle new window requests at a lower level. This ensured that
  any URL not belonging to  or  would open
  externally. The agent also refined TypeScript type declarations for a cleaner
  codebase. Finally, the updated application was built and deployed to the
  user's  folder.
