tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app and
  requested that external links within the app open in the default browser. The
  agent implemented this by modifying the Electron main process to intercept new
  window requests from the webview and open external URLs using
  .
overview: "The user started by setting up a Git repository for an Electron
  Messenger app and pushing the initial codebase. A key request was to change
  the behavior of links within the app: instead of opening in new Electron
  windows, external links should open in the user's default browser. The agent
  initially attempted to implement this by intercepting  events in
  the renderer process and using Electron's IPC to open URLs externally. After
  encountering TypeScript issues and a user report that the fix wasn't fully
  effective, the agent revised the approach. The final solution involved
  modifying the main Electron process () to use
   to intercept all new window requests from
  the webview. If a link was determined to be external (not Messenger or
  Facebook domains), it was opened using , preventing the
  creation of a new Electron window. The agent also created a  and
  successfully built and deployed the updated application to the user's
   folder."
