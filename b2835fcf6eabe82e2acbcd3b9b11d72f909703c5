tldr: The user wanted to set up a Git repository for their Electron Messenger
  app and ensure external links open in the default browser. The agent
  initialized the repo, configured , and implemented a robust
  solution for external link handling in the Electron app.
overview: The user intended to set up a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger application and modify its behavior to open external links in the
  system's default browser. The agent began by initializing the Git repository,
  adding a  to exclude build artifacts and dependencies, and pushing
  the initial codebase. For the external link functionality, the agent initially
  attempted to intercept  events in the renderer process. However,
  after the user reported an issue with links still opening in a popup, the
  approach was refined. The final solution involved implementing
   in the main Electron process to robustly
  detect and open external URLs using . This ensures that
  links to  and  remain within the Electron app,
  while all other external links open in the user's default browser. The agent
  also managed TypeScript type declarations and successfully built and deployed
  the updated application to the user's Applications folder.
