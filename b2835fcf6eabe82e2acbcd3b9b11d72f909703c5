tldr: The user wanted to configure their Electron-based Messenger app to open
  external links in the default browser instead of a new Electron window. The
  agent implemented this by intercepting new window requests in the main process
  and using .
overview: The user started by initializing a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project and pushing the initial files. They then requested that any
  links clicked within the Messenger app should open in their system's default
  browser, rather than a new Electron window. The agent first attempted to
  implement this by handling  events in the renderer process and
  using IPC to open external URLs. However, after the user reported that some
  links still opened in a popup, the agent revised the approach. The final
  solution involved intercepting new window requests at the main process level
  using  and  for
  webviews, which allowed for robust handling of external URLs via
  . The agent also created a  file to exclude
  build artifacts and dependencies, built the application, and deployed the
  updated  to the user's Applications folder.
