tldr: The user wanted to push their project to GitHub and then requested that
  links within the Electron Messenger app open in the default browser. The agent
  successfully implemented this feature, ensuring external links are opened in
  the system's default browser while internal links remain within the Electron
  window.
overview: The user initially wanted to set up a Git repository and push their
  project to GitHub. The agent helped by initializing the repo, creating a
   file to exclude build artifacts, and pushing all relevant files.
  Subsequently, the user requested that links clicked within the Electron
  Messenger application open in the system's default browser instead of a new
  Electron window. The agent implemented this by modifying  to handle
  IPC messages for opening external URLs using ,
   to expose this functionality, and  to intercept
   events from the webview. A function  was added to
  determine if a URL should be opened externally. Several TypeScript compilation
  issues were resolved, and a dedicated type declaration file ()
  was created for a cleaner solution. The outcome is that external links now
  open in the default browser, while internal Messenger/Facebook links remain
  within the Electron app.
