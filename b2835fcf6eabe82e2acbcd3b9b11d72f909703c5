tldr: The user wanted to set up their Electron Messenger app to open external
  links in the default browser instead of a new Electron window. The agent
  implemented this by intercepting new window requests in the main process and
  using Electron's  function.
overview: The user wanted to enhance their Electron Messenger application by
  ensuring that any external links clicked within the app would open in their
  system's default web browser, rather than spawning a new Electron window. The
  agent initially attempted to address this by setting up an IPC communication
  channel between the renderer and main processes, where the renderer would
  detect external links and ask the main process to open them externally.
  However, this approach proved insufficient as some links still opened in popup
  windows. The agent then pivoted to a more robust solution, implementing
   in the main process. This method intercepts all new
  window requests from the webview at a lower level, allowing the application to
  differentiate between internal Messenger/Facebook links and external URLs,
  opening the latter in the default browser. The agent also managed initial Git
  setup, including creating a  file, and handled the build and
  deployment of the updated Electron application to the user's Applications
  folder.
