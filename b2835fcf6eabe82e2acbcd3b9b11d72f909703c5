tldr: The user wanted to configure their Electron Messenger app to open external
  links in the default browser instead of a new Electron window. The agent
  implemented this by intercepting new window requests in the main process and
  opening external URLs using Electron's .
overview: The user initiated a Git repository for their Electron Messenger
  project and requested that all project files be pushed. A key feature request
  was to ensure that any external links clicked within the Messenger app would
  open in the user's default web browser, rather than spawning a new Electron
  window. Initially, the agent attempted to address this by intercepting
   events in the renderer process. However, this approach was found
  to be incomplete, as some links still resulted in popup windows. The agent
  then pivoted to a more robust solution, implementing  in
  the main process to intercept new window requests from webviews and use
   for non-Messenger/Facebook URLs. This involved modifying
  , removing the previous renderer-side logic, and creating a
  dedicated TypeScript declaration file. After successful compilation, the agent
  built the arm64 version of the Electron app and replaced the existing
  application in the user's Applications folder, ensuring external links now
  open correctly in the default browser.
