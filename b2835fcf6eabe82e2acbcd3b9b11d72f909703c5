tldr: The user wanted to set up a Git repository for their Electron Messenger
  app and configure it to open external links in the default browser. The agent
  initialized the repo, set up a , and implemented the external link
  functionality by modifying the main, preload, and renderer processes,
  including proper TypeScript typing.
overview: The user's primary intent was to set up their Electron Messenger
  project with Git and then implement a feature to open external links in the
  system's default browser rather than within the Electron application. The
  agent began by initializing the Git repository and, upon discovering many
  untracked files, proactively created a  to exclude common build
  artifacts and dependencies before committing everything. For the external link
  feature, the agent adopted a standard Electron IPC pattern. It modified
   to handle an  IPC message using ,
  exposed this functionality via  in , and added an
  event listener in  to intercept  events from the
  webview. This listener checks if the URL is external (not  or
  ) and, if so, prevents the default Electron behavior and calls
  the exposed  method. The agent also refined the TypeScript
  typing for the  by creating a dedicated  file for
  better code organization and type safety. The conversation concluded with the
  agent successfully building and packaging the Electron application.
