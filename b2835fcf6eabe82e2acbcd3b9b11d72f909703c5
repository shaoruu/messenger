tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app and
  then requested a feature to open external links in the default browser. The
  agent set up the Git repo, including a , and implemented the
  external link opening functionality by modifying the Electron main, preload,
  and renderer processes.
overview: The user started by setting up a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project. After an initial push of a , they requested to
  push all existing project files. The agent identified numerous untracked files
  and proactively created a  to exclude common build artifacts and
  dependencies before committing and pushing the entire codebase. Subsequently,
  the user asked for a feature where links clicked within the Messenger app
  would open in the system's default browser instead of a new Electron window.
  The agent implemented this by modifying the Electron app's  to handle
   IPC messages using ,  to
  expose this functionality to the renderer, and  to
  listen for  events on the webview. It then checked if the URL was
  external (not  or ) and, if so, prevented the
  default Electron behavior and invoked the  function. TypeScript
  compilation issues were addressed and resolved during this implementation.
