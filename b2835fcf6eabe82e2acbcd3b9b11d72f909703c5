tldr: The user wanted to initialize a Git repository, push all project files,
  and configure their Electron Messenger app to open external links in the
  default browser. The agent successfully set up Git, pushed the project, and
  implemented the external link opening feature, including deploying the updated
  app.
overview: The user's primary intent was to set up their Electron Messenger
  project in Git and then modify its behavior to open external links in the
  system's default browser. The agent first helped initialize the Git
  repository, including creating a  to exclude common build
  artifacts and dependencies, and pushed all project files. Subsequently, the
  agent implemented the external link functionality by modifying the Electron
  main, preload, and renderer processes. This involved using  and
   to expose a function that utilizes  for
  URLs not belonging to Messenger or Facebook domains. The agent also addressed
  TypeScript compilation issues and refined type declarations for a cleaner
  implementation. Finally, the agent built the application and deployed the
  updated arm64 version to the user's Applications folder. The conversation
  concluded with the agent investigating a reported issue where some external
  links still opened in a popup, suggesting further refinement by intercepting
   events.
