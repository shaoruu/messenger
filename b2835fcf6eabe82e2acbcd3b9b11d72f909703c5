tldr: The user wanted to initialize a Git repository and then modify an Electron
  Messenger app to open external links in the default browser instead of a new
  Electron window. The agent successfully set up the Git repo, configured a
  , implemented the external link handling, and deployed the updated
  app, though a minor issue with a GitHub link still opening in a popup was
  reported.
overview: "The user's primary intent was to get their Electron Messenger project
  set up with Git and then enhance its usability by having external links open
  in the system's default browser. The agent first handled the Git
  initialization, including creating a  to manage untracked files.
  For the link handling, the agent adopted a standard Electron pattern: using
   and  in the main process, exposing this via
   in the preload script, and intercepting  events in
  the renderer process. Several TypeScript type-related issues were encountered
  and resolved, leading to a cleaner solution with a  file. The
  application was then built and deployed to the user's Applications folder.
  However, the user reported that a specific GitHub link still opened in a
  popup, suggesting further investigation might be needed for certain link types
  or webview behaviors."
