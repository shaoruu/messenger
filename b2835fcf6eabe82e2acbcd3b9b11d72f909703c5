tldr: The user wanted to initialize a Git repository, push all project files,
  and configure their Electron Messenger app to open external links in the
  default browser. The agent successfully set up the Git repo, created a
  .gitignore, and implemented a robust solution for external link handling in
  the Electron app.
overview: The user started by setting up a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project, including an initial commit and pushing to GitHub. They
  then requested that all project files be pushed, which the agent handled by
  first creating a  file to exclude common build artifacts and
  dependencies, then committing and pushing the remaining source code. The core
  of the conversation revolved around modifying the Electron app to open
  external links in the user's default browser instead of a new Electron window.
  The agent initially attempted a solution in the renderer process, but after
  the user reported an issue, the agent pivoted to a more robust solution in the
  main process using  to intercept new window
  requests from the webview. This ensured that links to external domains were
  opened correctly. The agent also addressed TypeScript typing issues by
  creating a dedicated type declaration file. Finally, the updated Electron app
  was built and deployed to the user's Applications folder.
