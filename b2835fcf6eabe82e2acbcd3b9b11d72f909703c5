tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for their Electron Messenger app and
  then requested that external links within the app open in the default browser
  instead of a new Electron window. The agent successfully set up the Git
  repository, configured a , and implemented the external link
  functionality by modifying the Electron main process.
overview: The user began by setting up a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger application, including an initial commit and pushing all project
  files after a  was created to exclude build artifacts. The primary
  task then shifted to modifying the Electron app so that external links clicked
  within the Messenger webview would open in the user's default browser rather
  than a new Electron window. Initially, the agent attempted to implement this
  using a combination of IPC communication and a  event listener in
  the renderer process. However, this approach proved insufficient as some
  external links still opened in a small popup window. The agent then revised
  the implementation to use  in the main
  process, which effectively intercepts all new window requests from the webview
  and opens external URLs via . The agent also refactored
  TypeScript type declarations for cleaner code. After successful compilation
  and building of the arm64 macOS app, the updated Messenger application was
  copied to the user's Applications folder.
