tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app and
  then requested to push all project files. The assistant helped set up the
  repository, including a  file, and then implemented a feature to
  open external links from the Messenger webview in the user's default browser
  instead of a new Electron window.
overview: The user started by initializing a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project and pushing an initial README.md. They then requested to
  push all other project files. The agent identified untracked files and
  proactively created a  file to exclude common build artifacts and
  dependencies like  and  before committing and pushing the
  rest of the source code. Subsequently, the user requested that links clicked
  within the Messenger application should open in the default system browser
  rather than a new Electron window. The agent implemented this by modifying the
   and  processes to use Electron's  via an
  IPC channel. In the  process, an event listener was added to the
  webview to intercept  events. It checks if the URL is external
  (not  or ) and, if so, prevents the default
  Electron behavior and calls the  function exposed from the main
  process. The agent also iteratively resolved several TypeScript compilation
  errors during this implementation to ensure a successful build.
