tldr: The user wanted to initialize a Git repository, push all project files,
  and configure their Electron Messenger app to open external links in the
  default browser. The agent successfully set up the Git repo, created a
  .gitignore, and implemented a robust solution in the main process to handle
  external links.
overview: The user wanted to set up a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project and ensure that all external links clicked within the app
  would open in their default web browser. The agent first initialized the Git
  repository, created a  file to prevent unnecessary files from
  being committed, and pushed the initial project files. The primary challenge
  was correctly handling external links. The agent initially attempted a
  solution in the renderer process, but after the user reported that some links
  were still opening in a new Electron window, the approach was refined. The
  final solution involved modifying the main process to use
   to intercept new window requests from the
  webview and open external URLs using Electron's  module.
  This ensured that only Messenger and Facebook domains would open within the
  Electron app, while all other links would open externally. The agent also
  managed TypeScript compilation issues and successfully built and deployed the
  updated Messenger app to the user's Applications folder.
