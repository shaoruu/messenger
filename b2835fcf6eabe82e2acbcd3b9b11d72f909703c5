tldr: The user wanted to configure their Electron Messenger app to open external
  links in the default browser instead of a new Electron window. The agent
  implemented this by intercepting new window requests in the main process and
  using .
overview: The user initiated a Git repository for their Electron Messenger
  project and requested that all project files be pushed. The agent handled this
  by creating a  file to exclude common build artifacts and
  dependencies before committing and pushing the source code. The primary goal
  was to ensure that any external links clicked within the Messenger app would
  open in the user's default web browser, rather than spawning a new Electron
  window. Initially, the agent attempted to implement this by using IPC
  communication between the main and renderer processes, with the renderer
  listening for  events. However, after the user reported that some
  links still opened in a popup, the approach was refined. The final solution
  involved modifying  to intercept  events directly in the
  main process using  and
   for webviews, leveraging
  to open non-Messenger/Facebook URLs in the default browser. The agent then
  built the application and deployed the updated arm64 version to the user's
  Applications folder.
