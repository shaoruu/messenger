tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app and
  then requested that external links within the app open in the default browser
  instead of a new Electron window. The agent implemented a solution using
  Electron's  and  to achieve this,
  including creating a  and deploying the updated app.
overview: "The user began by initializing a Git repository for their
  Electron-based Messenger application and pushing the initial commit to GitHub.
  They then requested to push all untracked files, prompting the agent to create
  a  to exclude common build artifacts and dependencies before
  committing and pushing the project's source code. The primary task then
  shifted to modifying the Electron app's behavior: the user wanted external
  links clicked within the Messenger webview to open in their system's default
  browser rather than a new Electron window. The agent implemented this by
  modifying  to use  and ,
   to expose this functionality, and  to intercept
   events. After addressing TypeScript compilation issues and
  refining type declarations, the agent built and deployed the updated arm64
  version of the app. When the user reported that some links still opened in a
  popup, the agent identified that  in the main process
  would be a more robust solution for handling all external link navigations."
