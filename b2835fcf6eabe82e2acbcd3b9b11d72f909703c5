tldr: The user initialized a Git repository and pushed their Electron Messenger
  project. The main task involved modifying the Electron app to open external
  links in the default browser instead of a new Electron window, which was
  implemented and deployed, though a follow-up issue was reported.
overview: The user started by setting up a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project and pushing the initial codebase, including creating a
   to manage untracked files. The primary goal was to modify the
  Electron application so that any external links clicked within the Messenger
  webview would open in the user's default web browser rather than a new
  Electron window. The agent implemented this by adding an IPC handler in
   to use , exposing this functionality via
  , and adding an event listener in  to intercept
   events for external URLs. Several TypeScript type declaration
  issues were resolved, culminating in a dedicated  file for better
  type management. After building and deploying the updated application, the
  user reported that some external links still opened in a popup, indicating a
  need for further refinement, with the agent planning to investigate
   in the main process.
