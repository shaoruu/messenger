tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for their Electron Messenger project
  and pushed the initial codebase. They then requested that external links
  within the Messenger application open in the system's default browser instead
  of a new Electron window, which was successfully implemented.
overview: The user began by setting up a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project, pushing an initial . When asked to push all
  project files, the agent intelligently created a  to exclude
  common development artifacts and dependencies before committing and pushing
  the entire codebase. Subsequently, the user requested a feature where external
  links clicked within the Messenger webview would open in the system's default
  browser rather than a new Electron window. The agent implemented this by
  modifying  to handle an  IPC message using
  , exposing this functionality via , and then
  in , adding an event listener to the webview's
  event. This listener checks if the URL is external (not  or

  the exposed  function to open the link in the default browser.
