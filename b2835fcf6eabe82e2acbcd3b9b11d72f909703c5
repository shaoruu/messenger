tldr: The user initialized a Git repository and pushed their project to GitHub.
  Subsequently, they requested that links within the Electron Messenger app open
  in the default browser instead of a new Electron window, which was
  successfully implemented.
overview: The conversation began with the user initializing a Git repository for
  their messenger project and pushing an initial README.md. When asked to "push
  everything," the agent intelligently checked for an existing
  file. Finding none, it created one to exclude common build artifacts and
  dependencies like , , , , and
  before committing and pushing all source files to GitHub.The user then
  requested that links clicked within the Electron Messenger app should open in
  the default system browser rather than a new Electron window. The agent
  addressed this by modifying  to handle IPC messages for opening
  external URLs,  to expose an  function to the
  renderer, and  to listen for  events on the webview.
  It implemented logic to determine if a URL was external (not
  or ) and, if so, prevented the default Electron behavior,
  instead using the exposed  function to open the link in the
  system's default browser. TypeScript errors encountered during this process
  were promptly resolved, and the build was verified.
