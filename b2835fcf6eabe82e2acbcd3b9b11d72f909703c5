tldr: The user wanted to set up an Electron Messenger project, push all files to
  GitHub, and configure it to open external links in the default browser. The
  agent successfully initialized the repo, implemented the external link
  functionality with proper TypeScript, and deployed the built application to
  the user's Applications folder.
overview: The user's intent was to establish a new Electron Messenger project,
  ensure all source code was version-controlled, and enhance the user experience
  by having external links open in the system's default browser rather than
  within the Electron window. The agent first helped set up the Git repository,
  including creating a  to manage untracked files. Subsequently, the
  agent implemented the external link functionality by modifying the ,
  , and  processes to intercept  events and use
  Electron's  for non-Messenger/Facebook URLs. This involved
  several iterations to resolve TypeScript compilation issues, ultimately
  leading to a clean solution with a dedicated type declaration file. Finally,
  the agent built the application and deployed the arm64  to the
  user's Applications folder.
