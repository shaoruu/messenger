tldr: The user wanted to initialize a Git repository, push all project files,
  and configure their Electron Messenger app to open external links in the
  default browser. The agent helped set up the repository, create a .gitignore,
  and implemented a robust solution for handling external links by intercepting
  new window requests in the main Electron process.
overview: The user started by initializing a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project and then requested to push all project files. The agent
  assisted by creating a  file to prevent unnecessary files from
  being committed and pushed the initial codebase. The main challenge was to
  ensure that external links clicked within the Messenger webview would open in
  the user's default browser rather than a new Electron window. The agent
  initially attempted to solve this by intercepting  events in the
  renderer process, but this proved unreliable. The approach was then refined to
  handle new window requests directly in the main Electron process using
  . This robust solution correctly identifies
  external URLs and opens them using , while allowing
  internal Messenger and Facebook links to remain within the Electron
  application. After successful implementation and debugging of TypeScript
  issues, the agent built the Electron app and deployed it to the user's
  Applications folder, and pushed all changes to GitHub.
