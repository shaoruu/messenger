tldr: The user wanted to initialize a Git repository and push all project files,
  then requested a feature for their Electron Messenger app. The agent set up
  the Git repo, pushed the code, and implemented a solution to open external
  links from the webview in the user's default browser.
overview: "The user began by setting up a Git repository and pushing an initial
  README. They then requested to push all existing project files. The agent
  handled this by first checking for a  file, creating one to
  exclude common build artifacts like  and , and then
  committing and pushing the entire codebase. Following this, the user requested
  a new feature for their Electron Messenger application: to open external links
  in the default system browser rather than within a new Electron window. The
  agent implemented this by modifying the Electron app's , , and
   processes. Specifically, it added IPC communication to allow the
  renderer process to request the main process to open a URL externally using
  . The webview's  event was intercepted in the
  renderer to check if a link was external (not  or
  ) and, if so, prevented the default Electron behavior and
  instead called the exposed  function. TypeScript errors
  encountered during the build were also addressed and fixed."
