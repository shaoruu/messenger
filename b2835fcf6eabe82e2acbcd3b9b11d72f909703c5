tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app and
  then requested to open external links in the default browser instead of a new
  Electron window. The agent implemented a solution in the main process to
  intercept new window requests from the webview and open external URLs using
  the system's default browser.
overview: "The user began by initializing a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project and pushing the initial codebase. Following this, the user
  requested a crucial feature: external links clicked within the Messenger app
  should open in the system's default browser, not a new Electron window. The
  agent first created a  file to manage untracked files and then
  proceeded to address the link handling. An initial attempt involved modifying
  the renderer and preload scripts to intercept  events. However,
  this approach was found to be incomplete, as some links still opened in a
  popup. After reviewing the issue, the agent correctly identified that webview
  popups needed to be handled in the main process using
  . The agent implemented this by adding an
   check and using  for
  non-Messenger/Facebook links. TypeScript compilation issues encountered during
  development were resolved, including refactoring type declarations into a
  dedicated file. Finally, the updated Electron app was built and deployed to
  the user's  folder, ensuring external links now open correctly
  in the default browser."
