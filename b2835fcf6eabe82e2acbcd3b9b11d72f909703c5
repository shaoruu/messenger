tldr: The user initialized a Git repository, pushed initial files, and then
  requested to push all untracked files. The agent created a  and
  pushed the project. Subsequently, the user asked to open external links within
  the Electron app in the default browser, which the agent implemented by
  modifying the main, preload, and renderer processes.
overview: The conversation began with the user initializing a Git repository and
  pushing a README file. The user then requested to push all project files. The
  agent identified many untracked files, proactively created a  to
  exclude common build artifacts and dependencies (like , ,
  , , and ), and then committed and pushed the
  remaining source files to GitHub.Following this, the user requested that links
  clicked within the Electron messenger application open in the system's default
  browser rather than a new Electron window. The agent implemented this by
  modifying  to handle an IPC message for opening external URLs using
  ,  to expose this functionality to the
  renderer process, and  to listen for  events on the
  webview. It then checks if the URL is external (not  or
  ) and, if so, prevents the default Electron behavior and calls
  the exposed  function. Several TypeScript compilation errors
  were encountered and fixed during this process to ensure a successful build.
