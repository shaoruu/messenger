tldr: The user wanted to set up a Git repository and then configure their
  Electron Messenger app to open external links in the default browser. The
  agent helped initialize the repo, set up a , and implemented a
  robust solution for external link handling in the Electron app.
overview: The user's intent was to first initialize a Git repository for their
  Electron Messenger project and then modify the application's behavior so that
  any external links clicked within the Messenger interface would open in the
  user's default web browser, rather than a new Electron window. The agent began
  by assisting with the Git setup, including creating a  file to
  prevent unnecessary files from being committed. For the link handling, the
  agent initially attempted to use  in
  the renderer process. However, after the user reported that some links (like
  GitHub links) were still opening in small popup windows, the agent pivoted to
  a more robust solution. The final approach involved modifying the
  file to use  and
  . This allowed the application to intercept all
  new window requests from webviews at the main process level. If a URL was
  determined to be external (not  or ), it was
  opened using , otherwise, it was allowed to open within
  the Electron app. The agent also handled TypeScript compilation issues and
  built and deployed the updated Electron application to the user's Applications
  folder.
