tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for their Messenger project and then
  requested to push all files. The agent helped set up a  and pushed
  the project. Subsequently, the user asked to open external links from the
  Messenger app in the default browser, which the agent implemented by modifying
  the Electron app's link handling.
overview: The user started by initializing a Git repository for their Messenger
  project and pushing a . They then asked to push all project files,
  leading the agent to create a  to exclude build artifacts and
  dependencies before committing and pushing. The main task was to implement a
  feature where external links clicked within the Electron-based Messenger
  application would open in the user's default web browser instead of a new
  Electron window. The agent achieved this by modifying  to handle
  IPC messages for opening external URLs using , exposing
  this functionality via  in , and adding a
   event listener in  to intercept and
  redirect external URLs. TypeScript errors encountered during this process were
  resolved, and a dedicated type declaration file () was
  created for cleaner code. Finally, the agent attempted to build and package
  the application for deployment.
