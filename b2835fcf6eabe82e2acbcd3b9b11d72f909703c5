tldr: The user set up an Electron Messenger app and pushed it to GitHub. The
  main goal was to ensure external links within the app open in the default
  browser, which was achieved by implementing  in the main
  Electron process.
overview: The user aimed to establish an Electron-based Messenger application,
  push its codebase to GitHub, and then modify its behavior to open external
  links in the system's default browser. The assistant began by assisting with
  the initial Git repository setup, including the creation of a
  file to prevent unnecessary files from being committed. For handling external
  links, an initial strategy involved intercepting  events in the
  renderer process and using IPC to open URLs externally. However, this method
  proved insufficient. The successful approach involved implementing
   in the main Electron process. This allowed
  the assistant to intercept all new window requests from the webview, determine
  if a URL was external (not Messenger or Facebook domains), and then open it
  using  while preventing the creation of a new Electron
  window. The application was rebuilt and deployed to the user's Applications
  folder after each significant modification.
