tldr: The user first wanted to push all project files to GitHub. The agent
  helped by creating a .gitignore and pushing the code. Then, the user requested
  that links within the Electron Messenger app open in the default browser,
  which the agent implemented by modifying the app's main, preload, and renderer
  processes.
overview: "The conversation began with the user initializing a Git repository
  and pushing a README. When the user asked to push \everything\, the agent
  identified numerous untracked files and proactively created a  to
  exclude common build artifacts and dependencies before committing and pushing
  the project. Following this, the user requested a feature for the Electron
  Messenger app: to open external links in the default system browser rather
  than within a new Electron window. The agent implemented this by modifying the
  Electron app's , , and  processes. This involved
  setting up an IPC channel to allow the renderer process to request the main
  process to open a URL externally using Electron's  API,
  and adding logic to the webview to intercept  events and determine
  if a link should be opened externally."
