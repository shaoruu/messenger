overview: >-
  The conversation began with the user initializing a Git repository for an
  Electron Messenger project. After the initial commit of a README, the user
  requested to push all project files. The agent identified untracked files,
  created a  to exclude common build artifacts and dependencies
  (like , , , , , , and
  ), and then committed and pushed the remaining source code.

  Following this, the user asked for a feature where links clicked within the
  messenger application would open in the default system browser instead of a
  new Electron window. The agent implemented this by modifying the Electron
  application's , , and  processes. Specifically,
   was updated to use  and ,
  exposed an  function via , and  was
  modified to listen for  events on the webview. It checks if the
  URL is external (not  or ) and, if so, prevents
  the default Electron behavior and instead calls the  function to
  open the link in the system's default browser. TypeScript errors encountered
  during the build were also addressed and fixed.
