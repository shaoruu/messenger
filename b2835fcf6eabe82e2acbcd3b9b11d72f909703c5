tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app and
  then requested to push all project files. Subsequently, the user asked to
  modify the app so that external links open in the default browser instead of a
  new Electron window. The agent implemented this by intercepting new window
  requests in the main process.
overview: The user started by initializing a Git repository for their
  Electron-based Messenger application and pushing an initial README.md. They
  then requested to push all other project files, which the agent handled by
  first creating a  file to exclude common build artifacts like
   and , then committing and pushing the remaining source
  code.The primary focus then shifted to modifying the Electron app's behavior
  for external links. The user wanted links clicked within the Messenger webview
  to open in their default system browser rather than a new Electron window. The
  agent initially attempted to implement this by adding an event listener for
   events in the renderer process, using  to expose
  an  function to the main process. However, after the user
  reported that some links were still opening in a popup, the agent revised the
  approach. The final implementation involved intercepting
   events in the main process and using
   to check if a new window request was for an
  external URL. If it was,  was used to open the URL in the
  default browser, and the new window creation was denied. The agent also
  refined TypeScript type declarations and rebuilt and deployed the updated
  application to the  folder multiple times, successfully
  creating the  bundle despite recurring DMG build failures.
