tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app and
  then requested that external links within the app open in the default browser
  instead of a new Electron window. The agent implemented this by modifying the
  main, preload, and renderer processes to intercept new window events and use
  Electron's  for non-Messenger/Facebook URLs.
overview: The user began by setting up a Git repository for their Electron-based
  Messenger application, initially pushing only a README. After a request to
  push "everything," the agent created a  file to exclude common
  build artifacts and dependencies, then committed and pushed the entire
  project. The main task involved modifying the Electron app's behavior for
  links. The user wanted external links clicked within the Messenger webview to
  open in the system's default browser, rather than a new Electron window. The
  agent implemented this by modifying  to include an IPC handler
  for ,  to expose this functionality to the
  renderer process, and  to intercept
  events from the webview. A function  was added to determine if
  a URL should be opened externally (i.e., not  or
  ). TypeScript compilation issues were addressed by refining type
  declarations, ultimately leading to the creation of a
  file for a cleaner and correctly typed solution. The final outcome is that
  external links now open in the user's default browser, while internal
  Messenger/Facebook links remain within the Electron application.
