tldr: The user wanted to configure their Electron Messenger app to open external
  links in the default browser instead of a new Electron window. The agent
  implemented this by intercepting webview  events and using
  Electron's  via IPC, along with setting up a
  and pushing the initial project files.
overview: The user's primary intent was to enhance their Electron Messenger
  application by ensuring that any external links clicked within the app would
  open in the user's default web browser, rather than within a new Electron
  window. The agent achieved this by modifying the Electron main and renderer
  processes. It set up an IPC channel to allow the renderer process to request
  the main process to open a URL externally using . The
  renderer process was updated to listen for  events on the webview,
  identify external URLs, and then use the exposed IPC method to open them. The
  agent also addressed initial repository setup, including creating a
   file to prevent unnecessary files from being committed.
  Throughout the process, the agent iteratively refined the TypeScript
  implementation for type safety, ultimately creating a dedicated type
  declaration file for a cleaner solution. The final outcome was a successfully
  built application where external links behave as requested.
