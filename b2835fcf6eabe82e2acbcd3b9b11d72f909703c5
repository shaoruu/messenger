tldr: The user wanted to initialize a Git repository, push all project files,
  and configure their Electron Messenger application to open external links in
  the default browser. The agent successfully set up the Git repository, created
  a .gitignore file, and implemented the external link opening functionality
  with proper TypeScript typing.
overview: The user's primary intent was to set up a Git repository for their
  Electron Messenger project and then implement a feature where external links
  clicked within the application would open in the user's default web browser
  instead of a new Electron window. The agent began by initializing the Git
  repository and, upon realizing there were many untracked files, proactively
  created a  file to exclude common build artifacts and dependencies
  before committing and pushing the project. For the external link feature, the
  agent modified the Electron main process () to handle IPC messages
  for opening external URLs using . The preload script
  () was updated to expose this functionality to the renderer
  process. Finally, the renderer script () was modified to listen
  for  events on the webview, determine if the URL was external,
  prevent the default Electron behavior, and then call the exposed
   function. Throughout this process, the agent addressed several
  TypeScript compilation issues, ultimately creating a  file for
  robust type declarations.
