overview: The user started by setting up a Git repository for their messenger
  project. After an initial push of only the README, they requested to push all
  project files. The agent identified untracked files, created a  to
  exclude common build artifacts and dependencies, and then committed and pushed
  the remaining source code. Following this, the user asked for a feature where
  links clicked within the Electron messenger app would open in the system's
  default browser instead of a new Electron window. The agent implemented this
  by modifying the Electron app's main, preload, and renderer processes. It set
  up an IPC channel to allow the renderer process to request the main process to
  open a URL externally using Electron's . The renderer
  process was updated to listen for  events on the webview,
  determine if the URL was external (not  or ),
  prevent the default Electron behavior, and then invoke the  IPC
  method. Several TypeScript compilation issues were addressed during this
  process, leading to a refined type declaration strategy using a
  file.
