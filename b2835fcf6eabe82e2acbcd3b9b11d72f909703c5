tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger app, then
  requested to push all project files. The agent also implemented a feature to
  open external links from within the Messenger webview in the user's default
  browser, rather than a new Electron window.
overview: The user's intent was to set up an Electron-based Messenger
  application, manage its Git repository, and enhance its functionality.
  Initially, the user pushed only a , prompting the agent to create a
   to properly manage project files before pushing everything. A key
  feature request was to open external links from the Messenger webview in the
  system's default browser. The agent implemented this by modifying  to
  handle IPC messages for opening external URLs,  to expose this
  functionality, and  to intercept  events from the
  webview. The agent also refined TypeScript type declarations for a cleaner and
  more robust solution. The final outcome was a successfully built Electron app
  with the desired external link handling.
