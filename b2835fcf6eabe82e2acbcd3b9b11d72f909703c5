tldr: The conversation covered initializing a Git repository, pushing all
  project files while ignoring build artifacts, and implementing a feature to
  open external links from the Electron webview in the user's default browser.
overview: The user began by setting up a Git repository for their Electron
  messenger project. After an initial push of just the README, the agent helped
  push all remaining project files, first creating a  to exclude
  common build artifacts and dependencies like  and
  folders. Subsequently, the user requested that links clicked within the
  messenger's webview should open in the default system browser rather than a
  new Electron window. The agent implemented this by modifying the Electron main
  process () to use  via an IPC handler, exposing
  this functionality through the preload script (), and then in the
  renderer process (), adding an event listener to the webview to
  intercept  events. It checks if the URL is external (not
  messenger.com or facebook.com) and, if so, prevents the default Electron
  behavior and calls the exposed  function. Several TypeScript
  compilation errors were encountered and resolved during this process to ensure
  correct type handling for the Electron API.
