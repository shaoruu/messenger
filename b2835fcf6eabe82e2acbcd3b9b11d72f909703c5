tldr: The user wanted to set up their Messenger Electron app to open external
  links in the default browser. The agent implemented this by modifying the
  main, preload, and renderer processes, and also handled initial Git setup and
  app deployment.
overview: The user's primary intent was to enhance their Electron-based
  Messenger application by ensuring that external links clicked within the app
  would open in the system's default web browser, rather than within a new
  Electron window. The agent approached this by modifying the Electron app's
  , , and  processes. Key decisions included using
   and  for communication,  for
  opening links, and intercepting  events on the webview. The agent
  also proactively set up a  file for the initial project push and
  refined TypeScript type declarations for a cleaner implementation. The outcome
  was a successfully built and deployed Messenger app where external links now
  open in the default browser.
