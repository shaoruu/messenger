tldr: The user wanted to configure their Electron Messenger app to open external
  links in the default browser instead of a new Electron window. The agent
  implemented changes in the main, preload, and renderer processes, including
  type declaration fixes, and then built and deployed the updated application.
  However, the user reported that some external links still opened in a popup.
overview: The user's primary intent was to modify their Electron Messenger
  application to open external links in the system's default browser rather than
  within a new Electron window. The agent approached this by intercepting
   events from the webview. Key decisions involved using
  and  for communication between the main and renderer processes,
  and  to open URLs. The agent also created a
  file for initial repository setup and addressed several TypeScript compilation
  issues, ultimately creating a dedicated type declaration file for a cleaner
  solution. The updated application was built and deployed, but the user
  reported that some external links still opened in a popup, suggesting further
  investigation might be needed.
