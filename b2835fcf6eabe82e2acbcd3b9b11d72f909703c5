tldr: The user wanted to set up a Git repository for their Electron Messenger
  project and configure it to open external links in the default browser. The
  agent initialized the repo, created a , pushed all files, and then
  implemented the external link handling by modifying the main, preload, and
  renderer processes.
overview: The user's primary intent was to configure their Electron Messenger
  application to open external links in the system's default browser rather than
  within a new Electron window. The agent first assisted with initial Git
  repository setup, including creating a  file to exclude build
  artifacts and dependencies, and pushing the project to GitHub. For the main
  task, the agent identified that the application uses a webview. The approach
  involved modifying  to use  and  for
  handling external URLs,  to expose this functionality to the
  renderer process, and  to intercept  events from the
  webview. The agent also implemented a function to determine if a URL is
  external (not messenger.com or facebook.com). During implementation, the agent
  iteratively resolved TypeScript compilation issues, ultimately creating a
  dedicated type declaration file () for a cleaner and more robust
  solution.
