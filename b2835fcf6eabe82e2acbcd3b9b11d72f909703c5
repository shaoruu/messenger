  and then configure an Electron Messenger app to open external links in the
  default browser. The agent set up Git with a , implemented the
  external link handling, and deployed the updated app, though a new issue with
  some links still opening in a popup window arose.
overview: The user's primary intent was to set up their Electron Messenger

  using  and  in the main process, exposing an
   method via  in the preload script, and adding a
   event listener in the renderer to intercept and redirect external
