tldr: The user initialized a Git repository for an Electron Messenger project
  and then requested to push all files. The agent helped set up the repository,
  created a  file, and pushed the project. Subsequently, the user
  asked for links within the Electron app to open in the default browser, which
  the agent successfully implemented by intercepting new window events and using
  Electron's .
overview: The user started by initializing a Git repository for their Electron
  Messenger project and pushing a README.md. They then requested to push all
  remaining project files. The agent took the initiative to check for and create
  a  file, excluding common build artifacts and dependencies like
   and , before committing and pushing the entire project to
  GitHub. Following this, the user requested a feature where links clicked
  within the Electron application should open in the default system browser
  rather than a new Electron window. The agent implemented this by modifying the
  Electron main, preload, and renderer processes. Specifically, it set up an IPC
  channel to use  in the main process, exposed this
  functionality via the preload script, and added an event listener in the
  renderer to intercept  events from the webview. External URLs were
  identified and routed to the system browser, while internal Messenger/Facebook
  links remained within the app. The agent also debugged and resolved several
  TypeScript compilation issues during this implementation.
